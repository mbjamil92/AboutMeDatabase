# AboutMeDatabase

This was one of the projects for my grad school where we had to develop a database from scratch, create tables, insert information to give our introduction in a SQL world. 

Main SQL concepts used in this project are:

1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)
3. DQL (Data Query Language)
